### Description
Press an imaginary button on or off

 The Google AIY hat has 500ma drivers on 4 gpio pins and I use one to turn on a work space light.
 It would be nice to ask Alice to do that for me and this is my attempt to put all the pieces
 together for a module. This can use any free gpio for a non AIY system, just use a resistor and a led. 
 edit the python script to assign the gpio pin
