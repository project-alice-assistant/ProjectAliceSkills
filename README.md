# ProjectAliceModules (alpha3)

This repository is home of all curated and approved modules for Project Alice.

You can share your own creation as well!

To do so, fork this repository and start adding your modules in a sub directory of **PublishedModules** wearing **your Github username** as directory name. Once your modules tested and working, create a pull request for us to review your module, check it and approve it. Once your module is published it becomes available for everybody to install through the install ticket.

## Module Creation
The Alice Skill Kit can be used both to automatically create the structure of new modules and to validate them.
It can be installed using 
```bash
pip3 install alice-sk
```
Further informations on how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/project-alice-assistant/ProjectAliceSkillKit).
